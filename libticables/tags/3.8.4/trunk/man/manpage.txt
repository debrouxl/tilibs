TILP(1)                                                   TILP(1)



NAME
       TiLP  -  a  communication  program for TI calculators ('Ti
       Linking Program' or 'Tilp is a Linking Program')

SYNOPSYS
       tilp [-h] [-v] [-calc=] [-link=] [-adr_port=] [-dev_port=]
       [-timeout=]   [-delay=]   [-cmdline]   [-gui=]  [filename]
       [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       The tilp program allows you to backup, restore and archive
       variables of your Texas Intruments calculator on your com-
       puter. It has also  additional  features  such  as  screen
       dump,  remote  control, ROM dump, FLASHing. This is a very
       complete program.

OPTIONS
       The command line of tilp can be  used  for  sending  vari-
       ables. For sending one or more file, simply pass the file-
       name(s) on the command line, eventually with the  -cmdline
       option  if  you  do  not  want  to launch the Graphic User
       Interface.  It is possible to send one or more files (sin-
       gle/group  file  only)  or  one  file  which can be a sin-
       gle/group var as well as a backup, a FLASH app or an Oper-
       ating System even. You can not do any other operations. If
       you want more operations, you can use the interactive mode
       (-gui=prompt).  The tilp accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       -cmdline
              Send  file(s)  without  launching  any Graphic User
              Interface. Informations are displayed in the termi-
              nal.

       -gui=  Use  a  specific  graphic interface. You can choose
              prompt (interactive), console (not implemented yet)
              and gtk (GTK+).  In prompt mode, you can enter some
              commands. There are several  commands  which  allow
              you  to do the same things that you could do in GUI
              mode. These commands are: ready, screen [filename],
              dirlist   [filename],  backup  [filename],  restore
              [filename], send  [filename]  (variable,  FLASHapp,
              OS),  receive [filename] and dump [filename] (ROM).

       -calc= Select a calculator type: ti92+, ti92, ti89,  ti86,
              ti85, ti83+, ti83 or ti82.

       -link= Select  a  link cable type: Grey TIGraphLink (tgl),
              home-made serial or Black TIGraphLink (ser),  home-
              made   parallel   link  (par),  fastAVRlink  (avr),
              generic virtual link (vtl), TIEmulator virtual link
              (tie), VTi virtual link (vti), TI/PC USB link (tpu)
              or USB TIGraphLink (ugl).

       -adr_port=
              This value can represent either a  direct  address,
              either  a  link number, according to the link type.
              It will override the address  associated  with  the
              port specified in the config file.  Give the direct
              address of  the  parallel  port  (0x3BC,  0x378  or
              0x278)  or  serial  port  (0x3F8,  0x2F8,  0x3E8 or
              0x2E8), depending of the link cable type.  Give the
              link number of the virtual link (1 -> #0, 2 -> #1).
              Give the link mode of the  TI/PC  USB  link  (1  ->
              'raw' mode, 2 -> 'cooked' mode).

       -dev_port=
              It  will  override  the  device associated with the
              port specified in the config file.  Give the serial
              port   device   (/dev/ttyS[0..3])   for   the  Grey
              TIGraphLink  or  the  fastAVRlink.   Give  the  USB
              device (/dev/tiglusb[0..3]).

       -timeout=
              in tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while
              the program wait a response of the calculator. Once
              this  delay  elapsed,  the  program send a time out
              error. The default value is 1 seconds.

       -delay=
              in microseconds. This is the  time  which  separate
              the  transmission of 2 bytes.  The default value is
              5 microseconds. Decrease this  value  increase  the
              transfer  speed but decrease the reliability of the
              transmission.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This section describes the format of the .tilp config file
       which  is in the home directory of the user (Linux) or the
       tilp.ini file (Win32). The file is separated into  several
       sections  (hardware,  gui, calc, external programs, fonts,
       screen, misc). But, there is no order, you can write lines
       as  you want.  A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a com-
       ment. Each line has  the  following  format:  option=some-
       thing.   The  config file must have the 'RC_END' string at
       end.  Every line can be put in any order. Beware: any com-
       ment  added  to  the  file will be overwritten !  Below is
       described each option and the possible values:

       calctype= Defines the calculator type. Choose one  of  the
       following  value:  ti82,  ti83,  ti83+,  ti85, ti86, ti89,
       ti92, ti92+

       linktype= Define the link cable type. Choose  one  of  the
       following  value:  TIGraphLink, parallel, serial, AVRlink,
       fastAVRlink, virtual, TiEmulator, VTi, UsbGraphLink,  TiP-
       cUsbLink.

       port=  Define  the  port to use. You have to choose one of
       the following value depending on your link cable type  and
       the  port  you want use: parallel port #[1-3], serial port
       #[1-4], virtual port #[1-2], USB port #[1-4].

       method= You can specify here an I/O management  method  to
       use.  You  can choose: automatic, asm, dcb, kernel driver.
       Non expert users should choose automatic. The  libticables
       library will automatically determine the best method.

       adr_port=  If  you specify a value, this will override the
       default settings associated with the port  value.   Define
       the  I/O  address  of the I/O port to use. It can be 0x3F8
       for a serial  port  or  0x378  for  a  parallel  port  for
       instance.

       serial_device=  If you specify a value, this will override
       the default  settings  associated  with  the  port  value.
       Define the device name to use.

       baudrate= If you have a fastAVRlink cable, you may have to
       pass the link cable speed. This value  must  be  the  same
       than the cable one.

       timeout=  with  the  timeout value to use in tenth of sec-
       onds. Default value: 20.

       delay= with the delay value to use  in  micro-seconds  for
       home-made cables. Default value: 10

       rts_cts=  Enable  (on)  or disable (off) the hardware flow
       control (RTS/CTS method) for the fastAVRlink  cable.  Dis-
       able  it  can decrease the reliability of transfers unless
       you decrease the link speed. Above 9600 bauds,  flow  con-
       trol is recommended.


       xsize=  and ysize= Gives the X and Y values of the size of
       the left window. Default values: 300 and 400.

       clist_sort= Define the sorting method for the  right  win-
       dow.  Choose one of the following value: name, date, size,
       user, group, attrib

       clist_order= Define the sorting order for the  right  win-
       dow. Choose either 'up' or 'down'.

       ctree_sort= Define the sorting method for the left window.
       Choose one of the following value: name, info, type, size

       ctree_order= Define the sorting order for the left window.
       Choose either 'up' or 'down'.

       hidden_files=  Define  whether  tilp shows or hides hidden
       files (files which begin with a '.' dot). Possible  values
       are 'show' or 'hide'.

       confirm= Define whether tilp ask you confirmation when you
       delete some files. Use carefully !!! You can choose  'yes'
       or 'no'

       console=  Define  whether  tilp  will display some verbose
       informations or not. Under  Win32,  this  will  display  a
       background console. Values: 'yes' or 'no'.

       show_gui=  Display  the  Graphic User Interface in command
       line mode. Values: 'yes' or 'no'.

       path= Define whether tilp sends the variable in its origi-
       nal  folder  or  in  the  locurrent  folder. Choose either
       'full' or 'local'. Works only for TI89/92/92+.

       file_mode= Possible values are 'extended' or 'normal'.

       file_checking= Define the security level of file checking.
       Used  only when sending a TI File Format file. There are 3
       possible  values  which  are  'restrictive',  'middle'  or
       'none'.  The 'none' value disables any file checking (dan-
       gerous, must be used carefully !). The 'restrictive' value
       allows  you  to  transfer  only a TIxx file type to a TIxx
       calculator. The 'middle' value allows you  to  transfer  a
       TIxx  file  to some other calculators (a 82 file on a TI85
       for instance but you can not send a 82 file on a TI92  !).

       probe89_92_92+=  Depending on this value, TiLP will try to
       probe the calculator type before  any  operation.  Values:
       'yes' or 'no'.

       force_dirlist=  If you enable this options, TiLP will do a
       directory listing before sending any variable. This  allow
       TiLP to check whether a calculator variable already exist.

       unzip_location= Define the location of the program to  use
       for  unzipping  archives.  Most  of  the time, the 'unzip'
       string is enough.

       unzip_options= Define the options to pass on  the  command
       line  of the 'unzip' program. By default, all files of the
       ZIP  archive  are  deflated  in  a   directory   such   as
       'archive_name/'.  An option such as 'unzip_filter=*.89* -d
       tidir/' can be useful too.

       tar_location= Define  the  location  of  the  program  for
       untarring  archives. Most of the time, the 'tar' string is
       enough.

       tar_options= Define the options to  pass  on  the  command
       line  of  the  'tar'  program.  By default, this option is
       equal to 'tar_options=xvzf'.

       left_font_name= Define the font to use in the left  window
       (calc  files).  The  font is described by its XFLD (X-Font
       Logical Description) name.

       right_font_name= Define the font to use in the right  win-
       dow  (computer  files).  The font is described by its XFLD
       name,        such        as:        -adobe-courier-medium-
       r-*-*-*-125-*-*-*-*-*-*

       screen_mode= Define whether tilp display the entire screen
       of the calculator or only the visible part. This option is
       only  useful  for  TI89  calculators  because  they have a
       screen which has the same size than a TI92 one but only  a
       part  is displayed. The other part is only useable via ASM
       programming.

       screen_format= Define the image format to use  for  saving
       screen captures. It can be 'pcx', 'xpm' or 'jpg'.

       plugins_loading=  Define whether tilp loads the plugins at
       startup or manually (by the user). Possible values: 'auto'
       or 'manual'.

       locale=  Override  the  default  locale  ("C"  most of the
       time). Must be a string such as 'fr_FR' or  'en  _US'  for
       instance.

       Think  to  terminate  your config script with the 'RC_END'
       word !!!
