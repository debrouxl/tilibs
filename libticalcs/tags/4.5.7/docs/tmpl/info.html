<h1> General Information about the TiCalcs library </h1>
             
<hr>       
<pre>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></pre>
      The TiCalcs library is a part of the <a
 href="http://www.tilp.info">TiLP</a>    project and constitutes with the
other libraries a complete framework for    developping linking and/or TI
files oriented applications.<br>
   <br>
         
<h3>Overview </h3>
   The ticalcs library is a library which brings about all the functions
needed to communicate with a Texas Instruments graphing calculator (or hand-held).
Currently, it does not support some education devices (such as CBL/CBR and
others).<br>
<br>
  This library is able to communicate with handhelds in a fairly transparent
fashion.  With this library, the developer does not have to worry about the
packet oriented protocol, the file management and some other stuffs. <br>
   The library provides a complete API which is very easy to use and makes
 things easier.<br>
   <br>
  The library supports all the currently available calculators and their
associated  file formats:<br>
   - TI8x calculators: TI73, 82, 83, TI83+, 85 and 86 (with 2 sub-classes:
 TI73/83+ &amp; 85/86).<br>
  - TI9x calculators: TI89, 92, 92+ and V200PLT.<br>
  <br>
   This library has already been used by various projects (such as TiLP,
TiEmu)  and by other developers. The list of  developers/users can be viewed
on the TiLP web site (Developers section).<br>
   <br>

<h3>Requirements </h3>
This library is dependant of the ticables and tifiles libraries.<br>
At the time being, this library is dependant of the GLib (version 1.2), too. 
The GLIb is used for its GTree capabilites. This dependancy should be removed
 later with a built-in tree support.<br>
  <br>

</ul>
              
<h3> Bug Reports </h3>
        There may still be some bugs in the library, please send an email 
to  <a href="mailto:roms@tilp.info">roms</a>.<br>
    <br>
            
<h3> History </h3>
      This library is a part of the TiLP project. I have been working for 
3  years  on TiLP as well as on some other projects (TiEmu, TiGCC).<br>
      I wroten this library for several reasons:<br>
      - split code,<br>
      - share code between my various project,<br>
      - provide source code to others.<br>
      <br>
      As most of Linux programs, I maintain a file which lists modifications. 
  This is called a ChangeLog that you can find <a
 href="file:///home/devel/tilp_project/libs/cables/docs/text/ChangeLog.html">here</a>.<br>

<h3>Contact </h3>
         As I wrote this documentation and most of the parts of the TiLP
project,    surely the most of all questions will be addressed to me. So,
if you have    any questions, suggestions, problems, corrections, bug reports,
..., please    mail me at: <br>
       <br>
        <strong> <a href="mailto:roms@tilp.info">roms@tilp.info</a> <br>

       <br>
        Please, inform me about any noticed problem with the library and
the   documentation  (including wrong links in the documentation). This will
help   me to correct  the problem in a next release.  <br>
       <br>
        If you have a general programming question, it is a good idea to
see   whether  it is already answered on the <a
 href="mailto:tilp-devel@lists.sf.net"><strong>tilp-devel</strong></a>  mailing
  list. If not, you can post your question there. <br>
       <br>
        NOTE: Before asking me a question, please check whether this question 
  is  already answered in the <a
 href="file:///home/devel/tilp_project/libs/cables/docs/text/faq.html"><strong>Frequently
   Asked Question</strong></a> list: I have a job now. Thus, I have less
time    to give to questions.<br>
