  - Microsoft Windows, MSVC or MSYS+MinGW required for compiling from source

Libraries:
  - GLib 2 (required)
  - libticonv (required)
  - libtifiles2 (required)
  - libticables2 (required)

Tools for building from source:
  - make (required)
  - tfdocgen (optional, required to build API docs)

Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Untar the libticalcs2 archive, change directory to the libticalcs2 directory.

Type "./configure" (add --prefix option to install to a non-default location).

Type "make" and then "make install". "make install" requires root privileges
to install to the default, system-wide location.
