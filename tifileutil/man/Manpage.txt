TILP(1)                     General Commands Manual                    TILP(1)



NAME
       TiLP2  - a communication program for TI calculators ('Tilp Is a Linking
       Program')


SYNOPSIS
       tilp [-h / --help] [-v  /  --version]  [--calc=]  [--cable=]  [--port=]
       [--timeout=] [--delay=] [--silent] [--no-gui] [filename]


DESCRIPTION
       The  TiLP  program  allows you to backup, restore and archive variables
       and/or applications for your Texas Instruments calculator on your  com-
       puter. It has also additional features such as screen dump, remote con-
       trol, ROM dump, FLASHing. TiLP is a very  complete  program.  Moreover,
       you have the same program for all calculator models.


OPTIONS
       The  command line of tilp can be used for sending files like variables,
       backup, FLASH apps, OS, TIGroup, etc.  You cannot do any  other  opera-
       tions. If you want more operations, you have to use the GUI.  For send-
       ing one or more files, simply pass the filename(s) on the command line.
       If you want to use TiLP from console, use the --no-gui switch.

       Take care: options must be passed before the filename!

       tilp accepts the following options:


       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.


       -v, --version
              Output the version info.


       --no-gui, -n
              Send file(s) without launching any Graphical User Interface. All
              information is displayed in the  console.   Beware:  using  this
              switch disables any overwrite check. Use it with care!


       --silent, -s
              Skip  questions  in  no  GUI  mode. Should be used with --no-gui
              switch.


       --calc=CALC, CALC
              Select a calculator type: v200, ti92+, ti92, ti89t, ti89,  ti86,
              ti85, ti84+, ti83+, ti83, ti82, ti73 or nspire.


       --cable=CABLE, CABLE
              Select a link cable type: GrayLink, BlackLink, Parallel, Silver-
              Link, DirectLink, VTi, TiEmu.


       --port=PORT, -pPORT
              Specify on which port the link cable is plugged on. Can be null,
              1, 2, 3 or 4.


       --timeout=TIMEOUT, -tTIMEOUT
              in tenth of seconds (0.1 s). The program waits for a response of
              the calculator during that amount of time. Once  this  delay  is
              elapsed, the program sends a timeout error. The default value is
              1 second.


       --delay=DELAY, -dDELAY
              in microseconds. This is the time which separates the  transmis-
              sion of 2 bytes (in the old cables).  The default value is 5 mi-
              croseconds. Decreasing this value increases the  transfer  speed
              but decreases the reliability of the transmission.


EXAMPLE
       Quickly  send  (no  GUI) a file to a TI-89 through a BlackLink cable on
       the second serial port (/dev/ttyS1 or COM2), setting the timeout to 2s:


       tilp  --calc=ti89  --cable=BlackLink  --port=2  --timeout=20   --no-gui
       group.89g


       Starting at version 1.13, a new and shorter syntax can be used:


       tilp ti89 blacklink -p2 -t20 -n group.89g


CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This  section describes the format of the .tilp config file which is in
       the home directory of the user (*nix, Win32), or the old tilp.ini  file
       formerly  stored  alongside  the program (Win32). The file is separated
       into several sections (hardware, gui, calc, external  programs,  fonts,
       screen,  misc).   A  line preceded by the '#' symbol is a comment. Each
       line has the following format: option=something.  Every line can be put
       in  any  order. Beware: any comment added to the file will be overwrit-
       ten!  Here's a description of the options and their possible values:

       version= Which version of TiLP has written the  config  file.  Used  to
       display the Release the file and to keep compatibility.

       calc_model=  Defines  the  calculator type. Choose one of the following
       values (case insensitive): ti73, ti82, ti83, ti83+, ti84+, ti85,  ti86,

       cable_model= Define the link cable type (case sensitive). Choose one of
       the following value: GrayLink,  BlackLink,  Parallel,  SilverLink,  Di-

       cable_port=  Define the port to use. You have to choose one of the fol-
       lowing value depending on your link cable type and the  port  you  want
       use: parallel port #[1-3], serial port #[1-4], virtual port #[1-2], USB
       port #[1-4].

       cable_timeout= with the timeout value to use in tenth of  seconds.  De-
       fault value: 20.

       cable_delay= with the delay value to use in micro-seconds for home-made
       cables. Default value: 10

       remote view.

       wnd_x_size1= and wnd_y_size1= Gives the width and height of the windows
       in full view.

       wnd_x_size2= and wnd_y_size2= Gives the width and height of the windows
       in simplified view (no right frame).

       of the following value: name, date, size, user, group, attrib

       local_sort_order= Define the sorting order for the right window. Choose
       either 'up' or 'down'.

       full_gui= Display the right frame (local view).

       local_path= Use full path when sending variables.

       show_all= Show all files (1) or only TI files (0).

       attempt to delete files/variables. Use with care!

       recv_as_group= Receive set of files as a grouped file if enabled.

       name.

       local_font_name=  Define  the font to use in the right window (computer
       files).  The  font  is  described  by   its   XFLD   name,   such   as:
